<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am Monisha, an undergraduate student at Prince College of Engineering and an alumna of Zion School.I am passionate
  about hacking and web development, and my hobby is drawing. I am known for my adaptability, dedication, and hard work.
  My dream is to travel all over the world. I love traveling because it allows me to experience different cultures and gain knowledge.
  My short-term goal is to secure a decent job with a good salary and to build my career, ultimately reaching my long-term goals.

  I am an undergraduate with a flair for creativity and a keen eye for detail. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find
  me lost in the world of drawing, where lines and colors blend together to tell stories of their own. While I may not have a 
  defining achievement to boast of just yet, I am passionate about something that might seem unconventional to some â€“ spending time with myself. 
  For me, it's not about solitude, but about self-discovery and growth. It's where I find inspiration, reflection, and a deeper understanding of 
  the world around me. With a heart that's always open and a mind that's always curious, I am a breath of fresh air, ready to take on the world, 
  one sketch at a time.
